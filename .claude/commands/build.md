# Build

Read and execute: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Process

1. **Read the entire plan** - Understand all tasks, dependencies, and success criteria

2. **Execute tasks in order** - Implement each task following project conventions. Verify syntax and imports after each change.

3. **Run any validation steps** - If the plan includes tests or validation commands, run them. Fix issues before proceeding.

4. **Report completion** - Summarise what was done:
   - Tasks completed
   - Files created/modified
   - Test results (if applicable)
   - Any deviations from plan and why

5. **Update our PROGRESS.md**
