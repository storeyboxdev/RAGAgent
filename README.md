# Cloud Code Agentic RAG Masterclass

This repo is my bastardization of the tutorial. I changed the backend to nodejs and I'm using Laminar for tracing. I tried to build the code with LM Studio and Ollama models but only have 16gb gpu and couldn't move the needle enough.

Build an agentic RAG application from scratch by collaborating with Claude Code. Follow along with our video series using the docs in this repo.

## What This Is

A hands-on course where you collaborate with Claude Code to build a full-featured RAG system. You're not the one writing code—Claude is. Your job is to guide it, understand what you're building, and course-correct when needed.

**You don't need to know how to code.** You do need to be technically minded and willing to learn about APIs, databases, and system architecture.

## What You'll Build

- **Chat interface** with threaded conversations, streaming, tool calls, and subagent reasoning
- **Document ingestion** with drag-and-drop upload and processing status
- **Full RAG pipeline**: chunking, embedding, hybrid search, reranking
- **Agentic patterns**: text-to-SQL, web search, subagents with isolated context

## Tech Stack

| Layer          | Tech                                            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend       | React, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Vite    |
| Backend        | Python, FastAPI                                 |
| Database       | Supabase (Postgres + pgvector + Auth + Storage) |
| Doc Processing | Docling                                         |
| AI Models      | Local (LM Studio) or Cloud (OpenAI, OpenRouter) |
| Observability  | LangSmith                                       |

## The 8 Modules

1. **App Shell** — Auth, chat UI, managed RAG with OpenAI Responses API
2. **BYO Retrieval + Memory** — Ingestion, pgvector, switch to generic completions API
3. **Record Manager** — Content hashing, deduplication
4. **Metadata Extraction** — LLM-extracted metadata, filtered retrieval
5. **Multi-Format Support** — PDF, DOCX, HTML, Markdown via Docling
6. **Hybrid Search & Reranking** — Keyword + vector search, RRF, reranking
7. **Additional Tools** — Text-to-SQL, web search fallback
8. **Subagents** — Isolated context, document analysis delegation

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Install [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
3. Open in your IDE (Cursor, VS Code, etc.)
4. Run `claude` in the terminal
5. Use the `/onboard` command to get started
